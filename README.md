This is an RPG


Project Name: Untitled RPG

The main goal of my project is to make a simple rpg turn based game with randomly generated enemies. I plan on having a simple character creation system in place where users can input their own art if they wish. I plan on making a small index of enemies which will be randomly pulled from each time the user wishes to fight an enemy, dropping various loot and experience on completion. I'm thinking of adding a mad libs style element to the game, for example maybe having a list of adjectives the user can choose from to add modifiers to loot, enemies etc.

During the first week I plan on working on the character creation system, doing a simple set of stats and character customization elements. The second week is working on an enemy index, 3rd week a combat system. I have yet to decide if I want a super simple combat system or if  I want to have more options for combat. Week 4 will be adding loot and working on a progression system. Week 5 will be adding in any extra things like modifiers for enemies and loot and etc.

Worst case scenario I end up with simple combat without any modifiers or loot/progression or it doesn't work at all, best cast scenario I have all that and have a game I can update regularly with new things.

I plan on using Java to make the game as its one of the languages I have the most experience with, I may have to watch some tutorials here and there for image based Java elements.

I've always wanted to be a game developer and while I haven't really gotten any experience recently of doing so, I feel this is my chance to try my hand at it.
